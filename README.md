# üí´ About Me:
I find programming exciting becasue I enjoy the process of solving problems and building something that others can interact with. My coding journey began as a personal desire to learn how to build a webpage for an About Me project. This inspired me to teach myselft the base foundations of Software Development. As I continue learning about Software Development, I have found that my passion is Accessibility and Front-End. 

As I continue learning at the beginning of my journey to become a developer, I've accumulated hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am completing free online courses, follow-along videos, and online exercises. 

I am also interseted in other traning and developing opportunities for new Software Developers so don't hesitate to reach out with reccommdations. 

Feel free to view my progress in my repository.
